# Prediction-of-Inborn-Talents
Prediction of brain dominance percentages and inborn talents according to it.

# Utilizes advanced image processing and machine learning, specifically employing Dermatoglyphics Multiple Intelligence Test (DMIT) technology, for a sophisticated fingerprint analysis. This involves extracting minutiae and ridges to assess innate talents and cognitive traits. A formula based on these features determines brain hemisphere dominance and specific lobe percentages, generating a detailed PDF report with insights into inborn talents and career recommendations. 

# The technical implementation involves a MobileNet V2 CNN model and Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Computer Vision, for image analysis, and a SQLite database for data storage.
